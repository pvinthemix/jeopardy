## Jeopary Project
### Paul Vangelakos and Eric Fitzsimons

## Background
- Jeopardy features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions.

## What 
- This project asked us to build our take on the long-running television game show, Jeopardy. This game was built with client-side languages using Object Oriented Programming principles.  Using Javascript classes, our game can effectively instantiate 3 players and 1 round of Jeopardy that will have people laughing or crying for hours.

## Future Project Directions
- As we move forward with this project, we hope to implement the following functionality:
- 2nd and 3rd rounds
- Daily Double class that extends the Questions class
- Stopping and resetting the game
- Clean-up the styling aspects
